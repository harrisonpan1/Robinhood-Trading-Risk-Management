# Robinhood-Trading-Journal

This project is python scripts, which uses supported Robinhood API, [robin_stocks](https://github.com/jmfernandes/robin_stocks), and [Dash feature from Plotly](https://plotly.com/dash/open-source/) for 
creating visualized trading journal. You can varify and download to use it as personal trading journal for Robinhood and option risk management.

> **Note: robin_stocks package was [not fully updated](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/79291035/robin-stocks-robinhood-authentication-stopped-working). Need to pull the repo manually instead of pip update. You can just pull from my forked version since i have made some updates in the robin_stocks source code**
